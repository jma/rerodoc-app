_2017/02/15_

At its plenary assembly on Tuesday, 31 January 2017, swissuniversities, the Rectors’ Conference of Swiss Higher Education Institutions, adopted a national Open Access Stategy.

This Open Access Strategy envisages that all publicly funded publications must be freely accessible by 2024.

In spring 2017, swissuniversities will devise an action plan in association with various partners (SNSF, SERI, university libraries). Following its analysis and a consultation phase this coming autumn, the plan will be adopted definitively.

Open Access policies are gaining increasing significance worldwide: They indicate that publicly funded research results are a public asset, whose full utilization rests on free and unlimited access.

_2016/11/28_

The IOC Olympic Studies Centre has launched the Olympic World Library (OWL), an independent library catalogue, entirely dedicated to Olympic knowledge.

Being simultaneously a library catalogue and an information portal, the OWL gives access to all official publications of the International Olympic Committee and the Organising Committees of the Olympic Games, but also books, articles, and selected dissertations produced by academics and professionals from all around the world. It offers a single platform to access the digital and printed collection, and also connects directly to other platforms which publish Olympic content.

The collection of the Olympic World Library is no longer within the RenouVaud network, but accessible directly at: [www.olympic.org/library](www.olympic.org/library).
